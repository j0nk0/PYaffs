# Down in the dumps

I mentioned in the first post that tools exist that can be used to write/read flash for this family of devices. The most legit-looking one I found is called SPFlashTool and is available on [this site](http://mtk2000.ucoz.ru/), which looks somewhat affiliated to MediaTek.

(*TBD* try and find a legit page). The tool itself ships as part of a collection of tools named MtkDroidTools with much of the documentation in Russian.

Actually, MTKDroidTools does *NOT* have SPFlashTool. Plus, it basically automates everything else I've covered above *AS WELL* as the next post about untangling the yaffs dumps

Something about "scatter"

There was a dialog where I entered an offset and a size - that should tie in with the last section
