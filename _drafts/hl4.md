# Leitmotiv

Well over twenty years ago, the movie [Jurassic Park](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/) came out. There's a lot of exposition in the first third of that movie. In particular, there's a scene where a small group of people is given access -for the first time!- to an area of the island where very large dinosaurs roam free.

Among them is a man who is some sort of scientist and definitely not a people person. They happen upon a dino-sized dump of dino poo and yer man deadpans:

> That is one big pile of shit.

He's not alone, of course. Accompanying him on the tour is Dr Sattler, a paleobotanist. Dr Sattler takes a keen interest in how plant life has been recreated in the park and seizes the opportunity to take samples:

That scene, and this picture in particular, is both the theme and summary of this post. Reverse engineering is a dirty job but someone's gotta do it.

# Let's get started

So I [finally]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-07-31-Hacklog#3 %}) have a raw Flash ROM dump of the partition on which my phone's `/system` filesystem [lives]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-07-21-Hacklog#2 %}). I'm no longer constrained by file permissions - everything on that filesystem I now have access to.

I only need to figure out how.

## YAFFS

As I saw in the output of mount(1), `/system` is a `yaffs2` filesystem, mounted read-only:

	$ mount
	
	/dev/block/mtdblock11 /system yaffs2 ro,noatime 0 0

[`yaffs2`](http://www.yaffs.net/yaffs-2-specification) is the second revision of [`yaffs`](http://www.yaffs.net/yaffs-original-specification), a Flash-optimised filesystem that's been around a while.

My first idea was to open the `/system` dump with a YAFFS access tool. None of them worked with the dumps I got out of my phone and this little project lost momentum and got stalled at that point for three months.

I eventually picked it up again and decided to do this the hard way. In order to access the filesystem's contents out-of-band, I had to spend time reading and digesting both filesystems' specification documents. The `yaffs2` spec is not a standalone document so familiarity with `yaffs` stuff is pretty much required.

### A YAFFS primer

The basic unit of data storage in `yaffs` is a **chunk**. A chunk may contain *either* filesystem stuff of the kind displayed by [`stat(1)`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/stat) (viz. inodes, file names, permissions, etc.) *or* file data.

Within the scope of the yaffs documentation, filesystem entities such as files and directories are called **objects**. Every object has its metadata stored in a dedicated chunk in a data structure the yaffs documentation calls an **object header**

Something about spares

Something about object headers


It's pretty important to get the terminology right here, and to be consistent

## First part

### Chunk size

How did I figure out chunk size was 2048 bytes?

### Starting point

objectheaders as starting points as they are big, easy to identify and I can get a high degree of confidence that the way I parse them is correct

Then: Use the parent objectid field from the objectheader of a file with a known path to know what to look for in the spares of the parent. This assumes the chunk containing the parent's header is known

# Gruh

And what better way to get started than to have a look using a hex editor?

{% highlight sh %}
534-mboyer@marylou:~/Hacks/Nam-Phone_G40C/PYaffs [HL4:IÂ±R=]$ xxd -g4 ../images/system.img | head -n 825
{% include system_head.txt %}
{% endhighlight %}

The following patterns emerge:

- Every 512 bytes, there is a 16-byte chunk of data that seems to always start and end with `ff`

Yes it is, yes it is.
