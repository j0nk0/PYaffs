Hi, I'm Matt. Nice to meet you.

This is an attempt at documenting a little project I've been working on, on and off, for the last while. I hope to have enough material and enough momentum for a few posts. 

#Background

I came into possession of an Android phone this April. I say *came into possession* because the manner in which I got this phone is a bit unusual. I didn't buy it, I didn't steal it, I didn't find it and it wasn't given to me.

I won this phone at a claw machine.

Well, not really a claw machine but a twist on the same concept where you have to position then trigger a linear actuator so that the rod that extends goes through a narrow-ish keyhole. The machine looked like [this](http://soe-web-arcade2-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/sharedfiles/styles/game_image_large/public/Key%20Master%20Cabinet_1.jpg) and before you ask, I got the phone on my eighth try.

#The Nam-Phone G40C

So what about that phone? The IMEI sticker beneath the battery claims it's a **Nam-Phone G40C** while the serigraphy on the backplate informs us that it is a **Nam-Gear** product, designed by Namco and made in China. Since Namco is a well-known maker of coin-op games, it makes sense that they'd be involved in the production of prizes for their games.

I unboxed the phone, turned it on and proceeded to play with it. Here are my first impressions, in order:

- It actually works!
- ...but it's *really* slow!
- The display isn't very good
- That UI is all over the place

I realised at that point that this wasn't a device I wanted to use in earnest, or at least not with the firmware it had out of the box. My next thought was to try and find out whether I could use a build of CyanogenMod or some other trusted community build of Android that would work on this device.

First, of course, I'd have to learn more about the device. I used a spare Google account to access the [Google Play](https://play.google.com) market and downloaded two essential system info apps: [Under the Hood](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aws.apps.underthehood) and [CPU-Z](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cpuid.cpu_z&hl=en).

##Specs

Here's a summary of the phone's specs, taken from CPU-Z:

#On Rooting

Android apps can request *root* privileges from [Superuser](http://androidsu.com/superuser/) on a phone that has been rooted, that is to say on which an implementation of [`su(1)`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/su) has been installed. The Superuser app acts as an authorization broker, but it is the underlying `su(1)` executable that performs the actual privilege escalation since the `setuid` bit in its permission mode means it is executed with the privileges of its owner, viz. `root`. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) has a good primer on setuid and there's more [here](http://wpollock.com/AUnix1/FilePermissions.htm).

At any rate, rooting a phone is a big deal for Android power-users precisely because `su(1)` is typically not found in the firmware of a phone when it leaves the factory.

Now let's look at the last line from that screenshot again:

!["Wait, what?"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wut.png)

Could it be that this phone has `su(1)` in its factory firmware? I installed [Android Terminal Emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&hl=en) on the phone to have a quick look around the filesystem:

{% highlight bash %}
	$ ls -l /system/xbin
	ls -l /system/xbin
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       60276 2013-04-03 07:29 dexdump
	-rwsr-sr-x root     root         9820 2013-04-03 07:30 su
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       31508 2013-04-03 07:29 iwlist
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       17924 2013-04-03 07:29 iwspy
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       31176 2013-04-03 07:29 iwconfig
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       18024 2013-04-03 07:29 iwpriv
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       18360 2013-04-03 07:29 iwevent
	-rwxr-xr-x root     root       617348 2013-04-03 07:29 tcpdump
	-rwxr-xr-x root     shell       14280 2013-04-03 07:29 iwgetid
{% endhighlight %}

`su(1)` is definitely there. What's more, there's a file named `tcpdump` in `/system/xbin` belonging to group `root` where all others files there belong to `shell`. That's... interesting. [`tcpdump(1)`](http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html) is a packet capture tool. Its sole purpose is to record network traffic to a file for future analysis. As a network-y kinda guy, I'm a huge fan but it's a bit alarming to find it preloaded on a customer device. I couldn't find any mention of it in the UI, so I must conclude that it isn't there to be used interactively by the user. Which raises the question: why does this phone ship with privilege escalation and packet capture tools? Something's fishy here.

#Matt's Forensic Adventure

This was the starting point for this project. I have a device with something that looks a bit like malware on it. I have the time, the inclanation and hopefully the skills to find out more.

In future posts, I aim to achieve the following goals:

- Access the full filesystem
- Investigate the presence of `su(1)`, `tcpdump(1)`. What are they doing here? What are they used for?
- Gain superuser privileges
