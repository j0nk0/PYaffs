# A first look at su(1)

So I [now]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-08-12-Hacklog#4 %}) have access to the full filesystem mounted under `/system` on the phone. As I stated in the very first post, I have a special interest in `/system/xbin/su`. Based on the file's name and permissions, I have a [strong expectation]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-07-15-Hacklog#0 %}) it can be used to acquire superuser privileges.

I extracted the file using [PYaffs](https://github.com/mattboyer/PYaffs) and proceeded to inspect it.

	517-mboyer@marylou:~/Hacks/Nam-Phone_G40C [master:I±R=]$ stat su
	  File: ‘su’

	503-mboyer@marylou:~/Hacks/Nam-Phone_G40C [master:I±R=]$ file su
	su: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped

That's par for the course, there's nothing in the output of [`file(1)`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/file) here I'd call surprising.

## Building binutils for ARM

I've spent some time [poking around ELF binaries](https://github.com/mattboyer/optenum) in my day and so my first port of call was to build the excellent GNU Binutils package for the target architecture:

{% highlight bash %}
./configure --prefix=$HOME/Hacks/Nam-Phone_G40C/binutils_ARM/ --disable-nls --target=arm-none-elf && make
cd ../..
ls
cd -
make install
{% endhighlight %}

## A closer look

Since I aim to find out what it is *exactly* this `su` does, the first order of business was to find out more about the dynamic symbols it references. It's a fairly small file, weighing in at 9820 bytes and so it makes sense that much of what it does is factored out in external libraries. If these symbol refer to well-known API calls, then this would allow me to make inferences regarding the behaviour and function of the program.

Time to break out my ARM build of [`nm(1)`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/nm)!

There are some C++ symbols in there that look like they belong to [some sort of Android API](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html). The rest look like fairly common C standard library stuff. What's of particular interest here is the presence of [`socket(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/socket) and [`bind(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/bind). These are a strong indication that this program does sockety stuff.

# Deconstructing the binary

## Come feel the ARMs around you

As shown in the output of [`file(1)`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/file) above, my `su` is compiled for the ARM CPU in my phone. I've dealt with [x86](https://github.com/mattboyer/optenum), [SPARC](http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/resource/SunRIP.jpg), [m68k](http://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-92plus.html#9) and even [Z80](http://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-86.html#9) assembly at various points in the past, but this is the first time I'm going to have to wade through ARM code.

Or [Thumb-2](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0210c/CACBCAAE.html) code, rather:

{% highlight objdump %}
{% include readelf.txt %}
{% endhighlight %}

The thing about assembly is that it's a lot easier to read than it is to write. It's even easier when one focuses on reverse-engineering a small body of code! For that sort of job, the only thing one really needs is a passing familiarity with [basic instructions](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Chddgcje.html) (shifting values between registers, basic arithmetic and comparisons), [memory access](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Chdhbfcd.html) (reading and writing to memory, as opposed to the registers) and knowledge of [how argument and return value passing work](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0042e/IHI0042E_aapcs.pdf). The ARM documentation is pretty good for all of that and it's quite readable as well.

One thing I learned the hard way is that when an instruction references the program counter register `pc`, its value is that of the *next instruction*'s offset, ie. the current instruction plus an offset of 2 bytes if running in Thumb mode or 4 bytes if running in ARM mode.

## Disassembly

This is where the fun **really** begins. I want to get superuser privileges out of this binary. Just running `su` from an unprivileged interactive shell does *not* yield this result so I'm assuming that I need to do something else, possibly by means of a socket to trigger privilege escalation.

	$ id

I used `objdump -Csd` to dump all sections of the `su` executable and disassemble the `.text` section into human-readable ARM assembly in one go:

{% highlight objdump %}
{% include su_objdump.txt %}
{% endhighlight %}

I can see there are human-readable strings in the `.rodata` section. It's very likely that constant function call arguments are to be found in this section.

Reverse-engineering is largely an exercise in pattern identification and in this way it is one step removed from pathological [pareidolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia). Something *Gestalt* something something [bicameral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_%28psychology%29) [mind](http://michaelprescott.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451574c69e201901b7e2e2f970b-pi). This is why reliable information is so valuable in this process - it's what anchors us to the reality of the system under study.

So yeah. I'll have to watch out for addresses that point to `.rodata`.

The `.text` section in this file is large enough that figuring it out in its entirety would be a protracted exercise. Since what I really want is for this `su` to give me a root shell, I've decided to start from somewhere I know implements this behaviour I want and work my way back until I find out how I can trigger that.

I know thanks to `nm(1)` that my `su` has a linker table entry for [`setuid(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/setuid). The output of `objdump` very conveniently includes the names of PLT entries after the [`bl`](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Cihfddaf.html) and [`blx`](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Cihfddaf.html) function call instructions. As it happens, there's only one call to `setuid`, so I know that no matter what, I want to execute the instruction at offset `0x98c4`.

All that's left to do now is work my way up until I can figure out how I can cause `su` to execute this call. I've chosen to focus on the section of code in `.text` between this call and the first function header found before it, in this case the `push {r4, r5, r6, r7, lr}` at offset `0x97d8`. Here's the relevant section of disassembled ARM code:

## Scratching the Turing turntable

The instruction immediately preceding the call to `setuid` is a [`b.n`](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Cihfddaf.html) unconditional branch and the one before *that* is a [`bge.n`](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Cihfddaf.html) conditional branch. This is a pattern typical of compiled code that is found at the "seams" between sequences of instructions compiled from different control flow branches. The upshot is that if and when the ARM CPU executes the instruction at offset `0x98c4`, it must be after it's jumped there from somewhere else.

Sure enough, there's a [`cbz`](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0489e/Cjaghefc.html) conditional branching instruction that points here at offset `0x986a`:

{% highlight objdump %}
985c:        4860              ldr        r0, [pc, #384]        ; (99e0 <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0xb10>)
985e:        4478              add        r0, pc
9860:        f7ff ea72         blx        8d48 <puts@plt>
9864:        4630              mov        r0, r6
9866:        f7ff eae8         blx        8e38 <setgid@plt>
986a:        b358              cbz        r0, 98c4 <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0x9f4>
{% endhighlight %}

So that makes sense, right? First we set the effective Group ID with [`setgid(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/setgid) then if that returned 0, we move on to the effective UID. We even reuse the `0` return code from `setgid` as `setuid`'s argument.

The GID is loaded into `r0` from `r6` at `0x9864`. Before that, there's a call to [`puts(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/puts). The argument given to `puts` in `r0` is `*0x99e0(==0x03a7) + 0x985e + 0x4 == 0x9c09`, which points to a string in `.rodata`: "`huyanwei grant successful ...\n`". Looks like I'm on the right track, alright!

This call to `puts(3)` is preceded by a call to [`strcmp(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcmp) and a `cbnz` conditional branch instruction:

{% highlight objdump %}
984e:        4963              ldr        r1, [pc, #396]        ; (99dc <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0xb0c>)
9850:        6878              ldr        r0, [r7, #4]
9852:        4479              add        r1, pc
9854:        f7ff eac6         blx        8de4 <strcmp@plt>
9858:        4606              mov        r6, r0
985a:        b940              cbnz       r0, 986e <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0x99e>
{% endhighlight %}

This is very promising, as it means a zero return value in this call to `strcmp` is what triggers the privilege escalation performed by `setgid` then `setuid`.

So what are we comparing, and against what? The second argument passed to `strcmp` in `r1` is a static `char*` with a value of `*0x99dc(==0x03a6) + 0x9852 + 0x4 == 0x9bfc`. This once again points to a string in `.rodata` with the value "`*#huyanwei#*`". This includes the name of the author and looks like some sort of hardcoded passphrase. But what are we comparing against this value? The immediate answer is `*(r7+4)` but what is at that address?

To find out more, I searched for instructions before the call to `strcmp` that involve the `r7` register. There's a `mov r1, r7` at offset `0x983c` where we use `r7` as the second argument in a call to [`memcpy(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/memcpy), ie. as the source. Before that, we have the following:

{% highlight objdump %}
97f0:        687c              ldr        r4, [r7, #4]
97f2:        4977              ldr        r1, [pc, #476]        ; (99d0 <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0xb00>)
97f4:        4620              mov        r0, r4
97f6:        4479              add        r1, pc
97f8:        f7ff eaf4         blx        8de4 <strcmp@plt>
97fc:        b128              cbz        r0, 980a <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0x93a>
97fe:        4975              ldr        r1, [pc, #468]        ; (99d4 <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0xb04>)
9800:        4620              mov        r0, r4
9802:        4479              add        r1, pc
9804:        f7ff eaee         blx        8de4 <strcmp@plt>
9808:        b908              cbnz       r0, 980e <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0x93e>
980a:        f7ff fe93         bl         9534 <android::sp<android::IBinder>::~sp()+0x664>
{% endhighlight %}

So we copy `*(r7 + 4)` - the same address we'll later compare against `*#huyanwei#*` to decide whether to escalate privileges - into `r4` and then `r0`. This becomes the first argument passed in another call to `strcmp` at offset `0x97f8`. What's the second argument, then? `*0x99d0 (==0x3f8) + 0x97f6 + 4 == 0x9bf2`, which points to a string in `.rodata`: "`-h`".

Wait a minute! That looks a lot like one of the CLI options documented in the usage message, doesn't it? If `*(r7 + 4)` is indeed equal to "`-h`" then we jump to `0x980a`, else we compare that address again, this time to `*0x99d4 (==0x3ef) + 0x9802 + 4 == 0x9bf5`. Once again, this points to `.rodata` and this time to "`--help`".

I can now reasonably infer that `r7 + 4` points to the first CLI argument given to `su`. Considering we have `mov r7, r1` at offset `0x97e0` immediately after the function header, this would mean that -***GASP!***- `r1` was `argv` when the function was called!

Since we're looking at 32-bit ARM code, `argv + 4 == argv[1]`. This would make the function starting at `0x97d8` the program's `main` and `r0` our `argc`.

## Let's try it out

I tried running su with `*#huyanwei#*` as the first argument on the CLI:

![That escalated quickly]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/su_successful.png)

...and it worked. Yay!

# Now what?

So I've finally obtained superuser privileges on my phone. I did this by leveraging a rootkit that was present out of the box rather than writing a proper exploit. The whole experience was a bit hollow - I really expected to have to figure out what `su` does with sockets and build a program that would trigger escalation in this way. I was looking forward to that. Instead, I got there by feeding it a magic string as a CLI argument. It's expedient but a bit disappointing all the same. For a moment there, I... I believed. And I wanted more.

I did a teeny bit of searching online and there *are* pages that reference the author's name, Huyan Wei. They are mostly in Chinese however, which I cannot read. I chose not to spend too much time searching for third-party information as I know from bitter experience that nothing kills momentum on a little project like this quite like stumbling upon the answers.

As things stand I thought I should recap the objectives I set in the [first hacklog]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-07-15-Hacklog#0 %}):

- ✔ Gain superuser privileges
- ✔ Access the full filesystem (superuser privilege lets me access the full filesystem)
- ✘ Investigate the presence of `su(1)`, `tcpdump(1)`

So far, this project has been more about hacking than it has been about forensics. Now that I have unfettered access to the device, I expect this to change and future posts to focus more on the *what* than the *how do I get access*.
